# Manual describing approaches to measuring PCV impact using mortality and hospitalization, including minimum data requirements, and a framework for ensuring adequate application of relevant methodological aspects required for the use of time series methodology.


## Introduction (Cris)


## Mortality data from Vital Statistics (Cris)

##	Hospitalization data from administrative sources (Cris)

## ‐	Study design (DAN): 

###	Possible study designs for impact assessment
	Cluster RCT; step wedge; time trend/SC/etc

###	Time series analysis
	Types of models for time series analysis

###	Controls – conventional vs synthetic control approach
	Describe each one, compare approaches, and 

##	Defining the study question and objectives (CRISTIANA)

##	Data Sources (international and national for both mortality and hospitalization) (Cristiana)

##	Feasibility of conducting a time series analysis of secondary data to assess vaccine impact (Concepts) (CRISTIANA)

## Data management (MOSTLY CRISTIANA)

## Data analysis (text + web based tutorial) (DAN)
-	Data formatting
-	Descriptive analysis
-	Time series models
- Synthetic Control analysis
-	Incorporating co-variates into the analyses
-	Exercises

## Interpreting results (DAN)
	‘dummy’ results that highlight different scenarios (ie wide Cis with a point estimate <<1, wide Cis with a point estimate near 1, tight Cis with a point estimate near 1, tight Cis with a point estimate far from 1)
o	Communicating and Presenting results effectively (including suggested templates) (DAN AND CRIS)
